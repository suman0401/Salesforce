QUEUEABLE:
Because queueable methods are functionally equivalent to future methods, most of the time you’ll probably want to use queueable instead of future methods. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean you should go back and refactor all your future methods right now.
Another reason to use future methods instead of queueable is when your functionality is sometimes executed synchronously, and sometimes asynchronously.
 It’s much easier to refactor a method in this manner than converting to a queueable class. This is handy when you discover that part of your existing code needs to be moved to async execution. You can simply create a similar future method that wraps your synchronous method like so:

SAMPLE CODE:

public class UpdateParentAccount implements Queueable {
    private List<Account> accounts;
    private ID parent;
    public UpdateParentAccount(List<Account> records, ID id) {
        this.accounts = records;
        this.parent = id;
    }
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        for (Account account : accounts) {
          account.parentId = parent;
          // perform other processing or callout
        }
        update accounts;
    }
}

To add this class as a job on the queue, execute the following code:

// find all accounts in ‘NY’
List<Account> accounts = [select id from account where billingstate = ‘NY’];
// find a specific parent account for all records
Id parentId = [select id from account where name = 'ACME Corp'][0].Id;
// instantiate a new instance of the Queueable class
UpdateParentAccount updateJob = new UpdateParentAccount(accounts, parentId);
// enqueue the job for processing
ID jobID = System.enqueueJob(updateJob);

After you submit your queueable class for execution, the job is added to the queue and will be processed when system resources become available.

You can use the new job ID to monitor progress, either through the Apex Jobs page or programmatically by querying AsyncApexJob:

SELECT Id, Status, NumberOfErrors FROM AsyncApexJob WHERE Id = :jobID

Testing Queueable Apex:

@isTest
public class UpdateParentAccountTest {
    @testSetup
    static void setup() {
        List<Account> accounts = new List<Account>();
        // add a parent account
        accounts.add(new Account(name='Parent'));
        // add 100 child accounts
        for (Integer i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            accounts.add(new Account(
                name='Test Account'+i
            ));
        }
        insert accounts;
    }
    static testmethod void testQueueable() {
        // query for test data to pass to queueable class
        Id parentId = [select id from account where name = 'Parent'][0].Id;
        List<Account> accounts = [select id, name from account where name like 'Test Account%'];
        // Create our Queueable instance
        UpdateParentAccount updater = new UpdateParentAccount(accounts, parentId);
        // startTest/stopTest block to force async processes to run
        Test.startTest();
        System.enqueueJob(updater);
        Test.stopTest();
        // Validate the job ran. Check if record have correct parentId now
        System.assertEquals(100, [select count() from account where parentId = :parentId]);
    }
}

Chaining JOBS:
public class FirstJob implements Queueable {
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // Awesome processing logic here
        // Chain this job to next job by submitting the next job
        System.enqueueJob(new SecondJob());
    }
}
